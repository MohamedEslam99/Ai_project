Connect Four AI

This project is an implementation of the Connect Four game with an AI opponent. The game is played on a grid of 6 rows and 7 columns. The goal is to connect four pieces of the same color in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.

Features:
- Computer vs. AI Agent: Play against a computer-controlled opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.
- AI algorithms: The AI opponent utilizes the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make intelligent moves.
- Performance evaluation: The project includes a performance graph comparing the execution times of the minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms at different depths.

Key Components:
- Game Logic: Implements the rules of Connect Four, including valid move checking, win detection, and game termination conditions.
- AI Algorithms: Implements the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning for the AI opponent's decision-making.
- User Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for players to interact with the game.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MohamedEslam99/connect-four-ai.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd connect-four-ai
3. Run the game: python main.py
